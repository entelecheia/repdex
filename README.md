## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Project Overview**

The reputation of a company and its CEO is a critical intangible asset influencing organizational success. In today's digital era, news media significantly shapes public opinion, making it essential to quantify reputation effectively. This project proposes an innovative approach to measure the reputation of a company and its CEO using **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** powered by advanced language models such as **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, or Llama 3.1**, with **LangChain** serving as the main library to handle LLM requests.

The system, named **Repdex**, will serve as a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate the feasibility of using these models for ABSA in reputation measurement within a one-month development period. The project's codebase will be hosted in the GitHub repository: [entelecheia/repdex](https://github.com/entelecheia/repdex).

### **1.2 Objectives**
